**Issue Summary:**

- **Duration:**

  - Start Time: January 15, 2023, 10:30 AM UTC
  - End Time: January 15, 2023, 2:45 PM UTC

- **Impact:**

  - The outage affected the user authentication service, resulting in users being unable to log in. Approximately 20% of users were impacted, experiencing denied access to their accounts.

- **Root Cause:**
  - The root cause of the outage was identified as a memory failure in the database server.

**Timeline:**

- **Issue Detection:**

  - Detected on January 15, 2023, at 10:30 AM UTC through monitoring alerts indicating a spike in authentication failures.

- **Actions Taken:**

  - Immediately initiated investigation into the database server.
  - Initially assumed root cause to be a software bug affecting the authentication service.
  - Identified memory failure as the actual issue during initial assessment.

- **Misleading Paths:**

  - Explored network issues initially, suspecting a potential disruption in communication between the authentication service and the database. This path did not contribute to the resolution.

- **Escalation:**

  - Escalated the incident to the Systems Operations team at 11:15 AM UTC, providing detailed information on the ongoing investigation.

- **Resolution:**
  - Isolated the memory failure in the database server.
  - Replaced the faulty memory module with a new one.
  - Verified the fix and gradually brought the user authentication service back online by 2:45 PM UTC.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**

- **Detailed Root Cause:**

  - The issue stemmed from a critical memory failure in the database server, impacting the system's ability to process user authentication requests.

- **Resolution Details:**
  - The problem was mitigated by promptly replacing the malfunctioning memory module.
  - Extensive testing was conducted to ensure stability and prevent a recurrence.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**

- **Improvements/Fixes:**

  - Enhance monitoring for early detection of memory-related issues by implementing alerts for abnormal memory usage patterns.
  - Conduct a review of memory usage patterns to identify potential optimizations, including evaluating the need for additional memory capacity.

- **Specific Tasks:**

  - **Task 1: Patch Memory Management Software**

    - Description: Apply the latest updates and patches to the memory management software to address vulnerabilities and improve performance.
