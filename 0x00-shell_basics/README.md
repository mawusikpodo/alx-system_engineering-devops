 --Long format
 --with user and group IDs displayed numerically

- Task 8: Delete the file betty.
 --The file betty is in /tmp/my_first_directory```rm /tmp/my_first_directory/betty ```<br>
- Task 9: Delete the directory my_first_directory that is in the /tmp directory. ```rm -r /tmp/my_first_directory``` <br>
- Task 10: Write a script that changes the working directory to the previous one. ```cd -``` <br>

- Task 13: Create a symbolic link to /bin/ls, named __ls__. The symbolic link should be created in the current working directory. ```ln -s /bin/ls __ls__``` <br>
- Task 14: Create a script that copies all the HTML files from the current working directory to the parent of the working directory, but only copy files that did not exist in the parent of the working directory or were newer than the versions in the parent of the working directory.
You can consider that all HTML files have the extension .html ```cp -u *.html ../``` <br>
